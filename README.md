🚀 Optimizing ATM Performance: Insights, Revenue Trends & Business Solutions
I recently worked on an in-depth analysis of ATM transactions, revenue, and cost management across different states. The data provides valuable insights into financial trends, operational inefficiencies, and opportunities for optimization in the ATM network.

📊 Key Takeaways from the Report
💰 Total ATM Revenue: $616M
📈 Monthly Revenue: $41M
⚙ Total Cost (Maintenance, Operations): $295M
💵 Gross Profit Percentage: 59.45%
🔄 Average ATM Uptime: 92.2%

💡 What’s Happening & Business Problems Identified?
1️⃣ Uneven Revenue Distribution Across States
Some regions, like Mizoram and Assam, generate significantly higher revenues than others like Sikkim and Ladakh. This indicates inefficient ATM placement, where certain areas have low utilization despite high maintenance costs.

✅ Solution:
✔ Data-driven ATM placement – Shift focus to high-traffic areas to maximize transactions.
✔ Marketing & awareness campaigns – Drive more financial transactions in underperforming areas.

2️⃣ High Maintenance & Operational Costs
ATM upkeep, site maintenance, and spare part replacements cost $295M annually, reducing profitability. The challenge is to minimize unnecessary costs while ensuring service reliability.

✅ Solution:
✔ Predictive Maintenance – AI-driven insights to detect and fix issues before they cause downtime.
✔ Remote Monitoring Systems – Reduce on-site visits and improve cost efficiency.
✔ Automated Issue Reporting – Ensure faster problem resolution.

3️⃣ ATM Downtime & Customer Frustration
Despite an average uptime of 92.2%, some ATMs have frequent downtime, impacting customer satisfaction and reducing transaction volumes.

✅ Solution:
✔ Real-time ATM status monitoring – Identify problem areas before they affect customers.
✔ Better cash replenishment planning – Avoid "cash-out" situations at ATMs.
✔ Faster service response – Use automated alerts for quick issue resolution.

🎨 Role of Figma in the Design Process
In this project, Figma was exclusively used for designing UI components and dashboards, making financial data more interactive and user-friendly.

🔹 ATM Performance Dashboard: Designed to visually display revenue, uptime, and transaction trends.
🔹 State-Wise Transaction Maps: Created to illustrate how different regions perform financially.
🔹 Cost Analysis UI: Developed to simplify complex cost breakdowns for easy decision-making.
🔹 Collaboration: Allowed teams to review and refine designs in real-time before implementation.

🛠 Business Problems Solved with Figma
✅ Clearer Data Representation: Converting raw data into intuitive dashboards.
✅ Improved Decision-Making: Making complex insights visually accessible.
✅ Faster UI Design Process: Enabling quick iterations before finalizing the dashboard interface.
